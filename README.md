## Description

Kafka is one of the most powerful and widely used event streaming platforms, however the flow of data is widely misunderstood. The Kafka ecosystem is hard to understand and Kafka lacks a UI for monitoring. Onboarding is a problem to do its complexity. 

KafkaView provides real-time graphs displaying useful metrics for monitoring clusters, such as response rate, etc *add more metrics here*. Visualize your Kafka metrics and simplify the structure of your Kafka projects.


## Installation

*Describe the installation process, if any. Provide code examples and explanations for getting your project up and running.*

1. Decide where to clone this repository and type the following into terminal: 

```
_*git clone https://github.com/oslabs-beta/KafkaView.git--*_
```

2. Now type the following into your terminal:
- _*npm install*_

  Then type the following command:
- _*npm run dev*_

> [!NOTE]
> We should get a successful message saying the server is running on port 8080. If encountering an issue here, check if you typed 'npm install' or verify your current repository is correct.

3. Open the server up on [localhost:8080](locahost:8080) if it doesn't already do so. You just set up the front-end for monitoring your metrics!

4. Now we need to set up our backend. **Prometheus steps here.**

5. Congrats! You can now view metrics! Enter your _*broker IP address*_ into the text field and press _*enter*_.
