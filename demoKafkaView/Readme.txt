Welcome to the KafkaView Demo. This is an all-in-one demo meaning there is no need to use your own kafka cluster to demo our site.

To use our demo:

- Open the demoKafkaView folder in your preferred code editor.

- Type npm install into the terminal and press enter to install all dependencies.

- Type npm run start into the terminal and press enter.

    - This will build the webpack build and start the server.
    
    - If the browser does not automatically open, type localhost:3000 to view our page

Thanks for using KafkaView and enjoy!
